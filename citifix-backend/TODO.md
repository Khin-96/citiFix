# citiFix - Implementation Summary

## Project Overview
A complete Laravel 11 backend API for citiFix, a crowdsourced civic issues tracking system where citizens can report problems, vote on issues, and government officers can manage and resolve them.

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- **Laravel Sanctum** for API token authentication
- **Spatie Laravel Permission** for role-based access control
- Three user roles: `citizen`, `officer`, `admin`
- Registration, login, logout, and profile management endpoints
- Token-based authentication for all protected routes

### 2. Issues Management System
- Full CRUD operations for issues
- **Issue Lifecycle States**: `pending`, `verified`, `in_progress`, `resolved`, `rejected`
- **Categories**: Pothole, Streetlight, Garbage, Water Supply, Road Damage, Other
- **Priority Levels**: Low, Medium, High, Critical
- Location tracking with latitude/longitude
- Media uploads (photos and videos) with multiple files per issue
- Duplicate detection based on location proximity
- Advanced filtering: status, category, priority, location, date range
- Heatmap data endpoint for geographic visualization
- Role-based permissions for state transitions

### 3. Crowdsourced Voting & Verification
- Citizens can upvote issues to verify legitimacy
- Automatic verification when vote threshold is reached (default: 3 votes)
- Duplicate vote prevention (one vote per user per issue)
- Vote count tracking on each issue
- Automatic status change from `pending` to `verified` upon reaching threshold

### 4. Comments System
- Threaded comments on issues
- Media attachments support (photos/videos)
- Citizens and officers can comment
- Automatic notifications when new comments are added
- Full CRUD operations with proper authorization

### 5. Notifications System
- **Email notifications** (queued for async processing)
- **Database notifications** for in-app display
- Notification types:
  - Issue status changes (to issue creator)
  - New comments on user's issues
  - Issue assignments (to assigned officers)
- Mark as read/unread functionality
- Bulk mark all as read
- Delete notifications

### 6. Dashboard & Analytics
- **Statistics endpoint**: Total issues, by status, by category, by priority
- **Trends endpoint**: Issues over time (daily, weekly, monthly)
- **Category breakdown**: Distribution of issues by category
- **Location hotspots**: Most reported locations
- **Officer performance**: Issues resolved per officer
- **Data export**: JSON and CSV formats
- Role-based access (officers and admins only)

### 7. Gamification System (Optional)
- **Points system**: Users earn points for engagement
  - Report issue: 10 points
  - Vote on issue: 2 points
  - Comment on issue: 5 points
- **Leaderboard endpoint**: Top users by points
- User profile shows total points earned
- Encourages citizen participation
